# Nervous system organization

$meow pi/15$ 

## central nervous system
central with the brain and the spinal cord
sends signal to and from the brain and PNS and controls reflexes
### brain
directs mental process and maintains basic life functions
takes around a third of your daily glucose intake per day
## peripheral
caries from the brain and spinal cord to the peripheral
### Somatic
voluntary muscles and motor signals
### autonomic
involuntary like stress response

# Understanding neuron
nerve cells
I should be able to draw a loose neuron
basic building block of the nervous system
## cell body
contains the cell nucleus (aka SOMA)
## axon
conveys impulses away from the cell body

# key parts and functions of a neuron
## cell body
receives information 
## dendrites
receive information from other cells'
## nucleus
center of the cell
## myelin sheath / myelination
Covering the axon, made of pieces of myelin which insulate and speed up signals in the axon
signals jump in between the gaps of the myelin sheets which are called 
## nodes of Ranvier
the nodes that a signal actually travels through
## terminal buttons
the termination of the axon and releases chemicals called neurotransmitters
## SOMA
the cell body
## synapse
a connection between neurons
## action potential
a voltage across the axon

# Myelin production impacted
In the first few weeks and moths of like, myelin is very important. It's directly connected with social connection and response. Research shows that social isolation during there critical periods prevent cells from producing the right amount of myelin. Sadly this loss of normal levels of myelin leads to long term problems in cognitive functioning (Makinodan et al., 2012)

# Communication between neurons 
## synapse gap / junction or synaptic cleft
gap between neurons
## neurotransmitter
chemical messenger (Serotonin, Dopamine, etc.)
## Pre-synaptic neuron
transmitting neurotransmitters to the post-synaptic transmitter
## post-synaptic neuron
receiving neurotransmitters from the post-synaptic transmitter
Many complications with mental health and psychotropic medication interact with this interaction (SSRIs)
## SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
SSRIs interact with the reuptake of serotonin by preventing it and keeping serotonin floating around the synapse for the post-synaptic neuron to receive it. This is used to treat mood/anxiety disorders.
## Parkinson's
could be related to not enough dopamine, psychosis could be too much. Medications like SSRIs that interact with dopamine could change the interaction with molecules to assure a more balances amount of dopamine
## sending a chemical signal
released for the terminal button at the end of the axon, across the synaptic gap
## receiving a chemical signal 
receiving neuron (post-synaptic)_
## dealing with 'leftovers'
reuptake of neurotransmitters that did not get receive by the post-synaptic neuron get reuptake by the post-synaptic neuron
## Neural communication
Communications within a neuron is electrical, but
Communications *between* neurons is chemical

# Drugs
## Agonist Drug
mimics or enhances a neurotransmitters effect
most addictive drugs are Agonist
ex Parkinson drug (low dopamine) (SSRIs)
## Antagonist drug
blocks or hinders a neurotransmitter's effect
ex. anti-psychotic drugs (excess dopamine)
can be addictive by blocking aversive feelings 
## Effects of poisons and Drugs on neural transmission
### How natural neurotransmitters work
a normal neurotransmitter has the same characteristic (think a key in a lock) as a receiving neuron's dendrites.
Neurotransmitters without the right characteristic will not fit with the receptors and don't stimulate the dendrites. This blocks a signal at the receives
### A artificial drug on neurotransmissions
Artificially you can emulate both antagonistic (blocking) or agonistic (stimulating) neurotransmitters. These fit the characteristics of natural neurotransmitters and can react to the dendrites as natural ones
### natural androgynous Nero transmitters
endorphins that stimulate will be released with stimulation (ex. exercise, sex, rewarding activity)
naturally the body will not create excessive amount of endorphins
### artificial exogenous opioids
Will release excessive endorphins more than what is naturally possible
Addiction is a trained response to these endorphins, and this simplified by the high doses of endorphins.
The body will naturally adapt to this to tune the body to a normal amount of received endorphins by losing sensitivity to endorphins.
This over time will dull the reaction to natural reactions of endorphins and amplify opioid dependence
## Endogenous
inside of body already 
## Exogenous
anything we're taking form the outside
## natural
made from plants and animals
morphine, cocaine
## synthetic
made from chemicals in a laboratory. Typically, stronger.
Fentanyl

# Tools for brain research
## Function
### electrical recordings
### fMRI
tracks oxygen levels, which is an indicator of blood flow since your blood is oxygenated. So more oxygenated means more bloods flow and more oxygen being used. Active areas of the brain use more blood.
### PET Scan
Work by injecting a small amount of radioactive material into your blood flow. The PET scan show us what is metabolizing things and where blood flow is going by picking up background radiation from the injection
## Structure
### MRI
### CT Scan
### Other Methods
