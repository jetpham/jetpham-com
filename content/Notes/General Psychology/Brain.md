# Brain Organization and parts
- ## Hind Brain
  Essential/ automatic survival function 
  most primitive part of the brain
  located twords the back and lower, encapsulated the brain stem
  manages heart beat, breathing, digestion, essiecial things.
  Most ancient and similar to other organisms
  most protected by being deeper in hte head
  First developing as a embreo, it is prioratized in growth first until it's a fetus
- ### Pons
  Involved with **repiration**, **movement**, waking, sleeping, dreaking,
- ### Cerebellum
  Important for balance, and coordinated voluntary muscle movement
  also called the baby brain, is a distinct chunk of the brain located at the nape of the brain.
- ### Medulla
  Vital functions like heartbeat
- ## Midbrain
  Sleep/arousal, motor control, sensory function
  located in the center of the brain
- ### Brain stem
  Connects the brain to the spinal cord. The part where the
- ### Reticular formatoin
  In charge of arousal and screens incoming information.
  tells you how much awae you should be to the sensoy information that you recieve
- ### Spinal cord
  Responsible for transmitting info from the brain to the rest of hte body and controls reactoins
- ## Forebrain
  differenciates humans from other animals the most
  In charge of thinking emotion memory
  Develops latest in pregnancy
  it's the largest part of the brain
  and the least protects part of the brain
  located on the top and front on the outer of the brain
  In charge of memory and emotion
- ### Hypo thalamus
  Drives
  Basic human motivations (ex. thirsty, sex, agrression,) govern endoctrine system; linked to emotion and reward.
- ### Thalamus
  Brain's relay station
  Communication between different parts of your brain
- ### Amygdata
  A limbic system structiure
  In charge of emotions
- ### Hypocampuss
  
  in charge of memory
  also part of the limbic system
- ### Cerebral cortex
  ter mental processes. Covers the whole brain on the top and frontmost. 
  in charge of complex behavirs and higher mental processes
- # Lobes and hemisperes of the Cerebral cortex
- ## Lobes
- ### Frontal
- Speech production (Broca's is on the left)
- Includes the Motor control
- high functions like thinking, personality, memory
- ### Parietal
- Sensation
- Receives and interprets bodily senstations
- ### Occipictal
- Vision and visual perception
- ### Temporal
- Audition (hearing)
- Language comprehension (Wernicke's on the left)
- ## Hemispheres
  Left and right hemispheres are from the perspective of the person's brain. so smae as you, your left and your right are with your left hemi and right hemi spheres
  Thin outer layers responsible for most complex behaviors and high
- ### Forebrain is contralateral
  The right side is controlling hte left side and the left side controlls the right isde. 
  this is a commpn features of vertebrates
  when someone has a stroke then if the strk affects the right side of the brain then the the left side is affected
- ### Specializatoin of the Hemispheres
  each hemisphere only has slight areas of specializations but they work together
  right and left brained indicviduals are not distinct groups and are a myth
- ### Corpus callosum
  Connects the two hemisphere snad works in a coordinated way. Thick band of axons
  Cases of peoples copus callosum bring cut were common to reduce sezures
- ### Split Brain Vision
- The visual fiels also get process by the antilateral region of the brain. the left visual irld by the right briain hemisphere and etc.
- the nerves of the eyes are wired so each eyes has a left and right visual field distinctively

- # Nervous system organization:
- ## Peripheral nervous system
- ### Somatic
- ### Autonomic
- #### Sympathetic
  fight / flight / freeze response
- pupils dilate
- salicatoin dereases
- heart accelerates
- lungs dilate
- digestion end elimination decrease
- sexual climax
- sweating increases
- #### Parasympathetic
  rest / digest response
- pupils ocnstrict
- salivatoin increases
- heart slows
- lungs  construct
- digestion and elimination increase
- sexual arousal
- no sweating
