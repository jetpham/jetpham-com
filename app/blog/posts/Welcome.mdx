Today I start my blog on jetpham.com, a domain that I got for $0.01 on GoDaddy.com with one of their special deals

## Who am I?

I am currently a first-year computer science major at the University of San Francisco. I like computers, engineering, and art. I currently have a specific interest in linux, rust, hiking, novels, racecars, gliders, and food. I'm learning to speak Japanese to hopefully study abroad. 

## What do I want to do?

I want to make art with computers. Computers are such extremely powerful tools in our lives and the software that empowers them can enable us to create awesome things. While AI is cool, I personally stay away from it when I can.
